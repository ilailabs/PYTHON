You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.


```python 

        for i in nums:
            if(nums.count(i)==1):
                return(i)
        

```

**best**

```python
         code = 0
        for ch in s + t:
            code ^= ord(ch)
        return chr(code)
```
