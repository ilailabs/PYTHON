Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2


```python 

nums.append(target)
        nums.sort()
        return(nums.index(target))
```
