## 897. Increasing Order Search Tree

Given a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in **in-order** so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only 1 right child.

<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]

Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 100.
Each node will have a unique integer value from 0 to 1000.

```python
        def increasingBST(self, root, tail = None):
            if not root:
                return tail
            res = self.increasingBST(root.left, root)
            root.left = None
            root.right = self.increasingBST(root.right, tail)
            return res
```

```python 
def increasingBST(self, root, tail = None):
        
        # if this null node was a left child, tail is its parent
        # if this null node was a right child, tail is its parent's parent
        if not root: return tail

        # recursive call, traversing left while passing in the current node as tail
        res = self.increasingBST(root.left, root)

        # we don't want the current node to have a left child, only a single right child
        root.left = None

        # we set the current node's right child to be tail
        # what is tail? this part is important
        # if the current node is a left child, tail will be its parent
        # else if the current node is a right child, tail will be its parent's parent
        root.right = self.increasingBST(root.right, tail)

        # throughout the whole algorithm, res is the leaf of the leftmost path in the original tree
        # its the smallest node and thus will be the root of the modified tree
        return res
```

[What is linked list?]()
* like arrays - linear data structure; elements are linked to pointers.
* drawbacks of array: fixed, upperlimit in advance. same memory usage - irrespective of elements stored or not.
* inserting new element in b/w is expensive.

[Why to use linked list]()
* dynamic size and ease of insertion.
* drawbacks: random access not possible, sequence, extra space for every element(pointer).
* not cachy friendly.
