Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3

```python
l=len(nums)/2
for i in set(nums):
    if(nums.count(i)>(l)):
        return(i)
```

why set(nums): works and not nums: didn't work?
